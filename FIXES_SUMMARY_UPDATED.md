- Enhanced error handling with detailed error messages and logging
- Added `resetForm` function to clear the form after successful order placement
- Added proper user feedback for all actions

## Validation Improvements

All components now properly validate:
- Required fields (items, pickup date, pickup time, address, contact info)
- Contact information (name, phone, email)
- Address completeness (street, city, state, zip code)
- Phone number format (10 digits)
- Email format (Gmail addresses only)

## Error Handling Enhancements

All components now provide:
- Detailed error messages from the backend
- Proper user feedback for validation errors with visual indicators
- Comprehensive logging of error details for debugging
- Proper redirection to login page for unauthenticated users
- Graceful handling of network errors and payment failures

## Testing Results

### Comprehensive Testing
- ✅ Stain Removal Service: Orders created successfully
- ✅ Dry Cleaning Service: Orders created successfully
- ✅ Steam Ironing Service: Orders created successfully

### Validation Testing
- ✅ Missing phone number: Properly rejected with error message
- ✅ Missing email: Properly rejected with error message
- ✅ Incomplete address: Properly rejected with error message
- ✅ No items: Properly rejected with error message

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration
All components now properly use the `api` utility to communicate with the backend:
```javascript
import api from '../../api';
```

### Order Creation Process
1. User fills out the order form with comprehensive validation
2. Form validation ensures all required fields are completed before proceeding
3. User reviews order summary and proceeds to payment
4. Razorpay payment is processed with proper error handling
5. Upon successful payment, `createOrderAfterPayment()` is called
6. Order data is sent to backend endpoint `/orders/dry-cleaning-clothes`
7. Backend validates and creates the order with proper error responses
8. User is redirected to "My Orders" page with success confirmation

### Error Handling Flow
1. Frontend validation prevents submission of incomplete data
2. If any validation fails, user receives specific error message with visual indicators
3. If payment fails, user receives descriptive payment failure message
4. If order creation fails, detailed error is logged and user receives helpful backend message
5. All errors are properly caught, logged, and displayed to the user
6. Network errors are gracefully handled with appropriate user feedback

## Backend Validation
The backend validation remains robust and correctly validates:
- Required fields for all order types
- Contact information completeness
- Address completeness
- Data type validation
- Business logic validation

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Clear Error Messages**: Users now receive specific guidance on what needs to be fixed
2. **Visual Feedback**: Form validation errors are visually indicated
3. **Consistent Flow**: All service types now follow the same reliable process
4. **Reliable Order Creation**: Paid orders are now properly saved to the database
5. **Better Error Recovery**: Users can easily correct errors and resubmit

## Test Scripts Created
Several test scripts were created to verify the fixes:
1. `test-frontend-components.js` - Tests proper order creation with valid data
2. `test-stain-removal-validation.js` - Tests validation with missing fields
3. `final-comprehensive-test.js` - Comprehensive test of all service types
4. `test-stain-removal-frontend-simulation.js` - Simulates frontend data structure

All tests pass, confirming that the fixes are working correctly and the order creation issues have been resolved.
