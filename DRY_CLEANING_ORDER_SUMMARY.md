# Dry Cleaning Order Implementation Summary

## Feature Implementation Complete

We have successfully implemented the dry cleaning order functionality as requested. Here's what was accomplished:

## 1. Frontend Implementation (NewOrder.jsx)

- Modified the order submission handler to detect when a dry cleaning (shoe care) order is being placed
- When the "shoe-care" service is selected, the form data is sent to a dedicated endpoint
- All required information is collected from the user:
  - Shoe type (from service selection)
  - Service type ("shoe-care")
  - Number of pairs (item quantity)
  - Pickup date and time
  - Complete pickup address (street, city, state, ZIP code, special instructions)
  - Contact information (name, phone number, email)

## 2. Backend Implementation (Order Routes)

- Added a new endpoint `/api/orders/dry-cleaning` specifically for handling dry cleaning orders
- Implemented comprehensive validation to ensure all required fields are present
- Added special validation for shoe care orders to ensure complete pickup address
- Orders are stored in MongoDB with confirmation response

## 3. Database Implementation (Order Model)

- Enhanced the Order model with pre-save validation for shoe care orders
- Ensures that all required address fields are present for shoe care services
- All order details are properly stored in MongoDB as specified

## 4. Required Fields Storage

All the requested information is now stored in MongoDB when a dry cleaning order is placed:

- ✅ Shoe type
- ✅ Service type
- ✅ Number of pairs
- ✅ Pickup date
- ✅ Pickup time
- ✅ Pickup address (street, city, state, ZIP code, special instructions)
- ✅ Contact information (name, phone number, email)

## 5. Validation & Error Handling

- Comprehensive validation ensures data integrity
- Proper error messages are returned to users when required information is missing
- Special validation for shoe care orders to ensure complete address information

## 6. Testing

- Created unit tests to verify functionality
- Tests confirm proper validation of incomplete addresses
- Demonstrated successful order creation flow

## 7. Documentation

- Created detailed documentation explaining the feature
- Provided clear instructions for testing and verification

## How It Works

1. User selects "Shoe Care" service in the New Order form
2. User fills in all required information including pickup address and contact details
3. Upon submission, if a shoe care service is detected, data is sent to `/api/orders/dry-cleaning`
4. Backend validates all required fields
5. Order is saved to MongoDB
6. Success confirmation is sent back to the frontend

The implementation fully satisfies the requirements and provides a robust solution for storing dry cleaning orders in MongoDB.
