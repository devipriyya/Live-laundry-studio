# Customer Management Authorization Fix

## Problem
The customer management page shows the error: "Failed to load customers: Not authorized"

## Root Cause
The customer management feature requires administrator privileges to access the `/auth/users` API endpoint. This endpoint is protected by both authentication and role-based access control middleware.

## Solution
We've implemented better error handling and user guidance in the customer management component:

1. **Enhanced Error Messages**: More specific error messages for different authorization scenarios
2. **Admin Access Guidance**: A helpful message with a direct link to the admin login page when authorization fails
3. **Retry Functionality**: Users can retry the request after logging in as an admin

## How to Access Customer Management

### Method 1: Use the Debug Login Page (Recommended)
1. Navigate to `/admin-login-debug`
2. Click on the "Admin" card to log in with admin privileges
3. You'll be automatically redirected to the admin dashboard
4. Navigate to the "Customers" section or go directly to `/customer-management`

### Method 2: Log in with Real Admin Credentials
If you have real admin credentials:
1. Log out of your current session
2. Log in using admin credentials
3. Navigate to the customer management page

### Method 3: Use the Admin Access Guidance
When you see the authorization error:
1. Click the "Go to Admin Login" button in the error message
2. Follow the steps in Method 1

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints
- **GET `/auth/users`** - Fetch all users (Admin only)
- **GET `/auth/users/:id`** - Fetch a specific user (Admin only)
- **PUT `/auth/users/:id`** - Update a user (Admin only)
- **DELETE `/auth/users/:id`** - Delete a user (Admin only)
- **PATCH `/auth/users/:id/block`** - Block/unblock a user (Admin only)

### Middleware Protection
1. **protect** - Ensures a valid JWT token is present
2. **isAdmin** - Ensures the user has the 'admin' role

### Role Requirements
Only users with the `admin` role can access customer management features.

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/CustomerManagement.jsx` - Enhanced error handling and user guidance

## Testing
After implementing the fix:
1. Try accessing `/customer-management` without logging in as admin
2. Verify that the helpful error message and admin login link appear
3. Use the admin login link to gain proper access
4. Confirm that customer data loads correctly after admin login
