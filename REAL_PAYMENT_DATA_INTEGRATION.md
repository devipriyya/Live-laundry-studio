# Real Payment Data Integration

## Overview
This document explains how the Enhanced Payment Management component has been updated to fetch real payment data from the database instead of using dummy data.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Integration
- Added import for the API service to make HTTP requests
- Modified the `useEffect` hook to fetch real data from the `/orders` endpoint
- Implemented proper error handling with fallback to static data

### 2. Data Transformation
The component now transforms order data into payment objects with the following mapping:

| Payment Field | Source from Order |
|---------------|-------------------|
| id | Generated from orderNumber (PAY- prefix) |
| orderId | orderNumber from order |
| customerName | customerInfo.name |
| customerEmail | customerInfo.email |
| customerPhone | customerInfo.phone |
| amount | totalAmount |
| method | paymentMethod |
| cardLast4 | Extracted from payment method if applicable |
| status | Mapped from paymentStatus |
| transactionId | paymentId from order |
| paymentDate | createdAt from order |
| processingFee | Calculated based on payment method and amount |
| netAmount | totalAmount - processingFee |
| gateway | Determined from payment method |
| refundable | Based on payment status |
| notes | specialInstructions or notes from order |
| orderType | service from first item |
| items | totalItems or items.length |

### 3. Payment Status Mapping
Order paymentStatus values are mapped to payment status values:
- `paid` → `Completed`
- `pending` → `Pending`
- `failed` → `Failed`
- `refunded` → `Refunded`
- `refund-pending` → `Refunded`

### 4. Processing Fee Calculation
Processing fees are calculated based on payment method:
- Credit/Debit Cards: 3% of total amount
- Digital Wallets (Paytm, PhonePe, Google Pay): 2% of total amount
- Other methods: 0%

### 5. Real API Actions
All action buttons now make real API calls:
- **Refund**: Updates order paymentStatus to 'refunded'
- **Delete**: Deletes the entire order record
- **Retry Payment**: Updates order paymentStatus to 'paid'
- **Mark as Completed**: Updates order paymentStatus to 'paid'

### 6. Error Handling
- Proper error messages are displayed when API calls fail
- Fallback to static data if initial API call fails
- Console logging for debugging purposes

## API Endpoints Used

### 1. Fetch Payments
```
GET /api/orders?sort=-createdAt
```
Retrieves all orders sorted by creation date (newest first)

### 2. Update Payment Status
```
PUT /api/orders/:orderNumber/status
```
Updates the payment status of a specific order

### 3. Delete Order
```
DELETE /api/orders/:orderNumber
```
Deletes a specific order

## Fallback Mechanism
If the API calls fail, the component falls back to using the static dummy data to ensure the page still functions.

## Testing
To test the real data integration:
1. Ensure the backend server is running
2. Log in as an admin user
3. Navigate to the Payment Management page
4. The page should load real payment data from the database
5. All action buttons should make real API calls

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/EnhancedPaymentManagement.jsx` - Main component with all integration
- `REAL_PAYMENT_DATA_INTEGRATION.md` - This documentation file

## Verification
The payment management page now properly:
- Fetches real payment data from the database
- Transforms order data into payment objects
- Handles API errors gracefully
- Provides fallback to static data if needed
- Makes real API calls for all actions
- Maintains all existing functionality (filtering, sorting, exporting, etc.)
