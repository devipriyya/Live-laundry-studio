Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5174/admin-login-debug

2. Click the **"Login as Admin"** button
3. This will set you as an admin user

### Step 3: Access the Dashboard
1. After logging in, click **"Go to Admin Dashboard"**
2. Or manually navigate to: `http://localhost:5174/admin-dashboard`
