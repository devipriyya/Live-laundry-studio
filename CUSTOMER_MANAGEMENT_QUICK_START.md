- **Admin**: Administrators with full access
- **Delivery Staff**: Delivery personnel who handle deliveries

### Blocked Users
- Blocked users cannot login
- Their existing orders remain in the system
- They can be unblocked at any time
- Blocking is reversible, deleting is not

## API Endpoints Used

The frontend calls these backend APIs:

```
GET    /api/auth/users              - Fetch all users
GET    /api/auth/users/:id          - Get single user
PUT    /api/auth/users/:id          - Update user
DELETE /api/auth/users/:id          - Delete user
PATCH  /api/auth/users/:id/block    - Block/unblock user
GET    /api/auth/users/:id/orders   - Get user's orders
```

All these endpoints require admin authentication.
