## üêõ Known Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **No Pagination**: All users loaded at once (may be slow with 1000+ users)
2. **No Bulk Operations**: Cannot select multiple users for batch actions
3. **No Export**: Cannot download user list as CSV/Excel
4. **No Activity Log**: User management actions not logged
5. **No Password Reset**: Admins cannot reset user passwords

### Workarounds
- **Large Lists**: Use search and filters to narrow results
- **Bulk Actions**: Perform individually (future enhancement planned)
- **Export**: Use database tools for now
- **Logs**: Check server logs for API calls
- **Passwords**: Users must use "Forgot Password" feature

---
