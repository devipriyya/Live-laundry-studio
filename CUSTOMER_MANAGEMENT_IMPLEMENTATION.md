  - Account Status (Active/Blocked)

### 2. **Filter and Search** ✅

- Filter by status (All/Active/Blocked)

### 3. **View User Details** ✅
Admin can view comprehensive user information:
- Personal information (name, email, phone, addresses)
- Account status and role
- Order statistics (total orders, total spent, loyalty points)
- User preferences (language, currency, theme)
- Recent order history

### 4. **Edit User Information** ✅

- Name
- Email
- Phone number
- Role (Customer/Admin/Delivery Staff)

### 5. **Suspend/Unsuspend Users** ✅

- Active users show green badge

### 6. **Delete Users** ✅

- Confirmation modal prevents accidental deletion
- Warning message clearly states the action is irreversible

## Backend API Endpoints

All endpoints require admin authentication (`protect` + `isAdmin` middleware):

### Get All Users
```
GET /api/auth/users
Query Parameters: role, search, status
Response: { users: [...] }
```

### Get Single User
```
GET /api/auth/users/:id
Response: User object (without password)
```

### Update User
```
PUT /api/auth/users/:id
Body: { name, email, phone, role, addresses, preferences }
Response: { message, user }
```

### Delete User
```
DELETE /api/auth/users/:id
Response: { message }
```

### Block/Unblock User
```
PATCH /api/auth/users/:id/block
Body: { isBlocked: true/false }
Response: { message, user }
```

### Get User Orders
```
GET /api/auth/users/:id/orders
Response: { orders: [...] }
```

## Frontend Component Structure

### Main Component
`frontend/src/components/CustomerManagement.jsx`

### Key Features:
1. **Statistics Cards**
   - Total Users
   - Total Customers
   - Total Admins
   - Blocked Users

2. **Action Buttons**
   - 👁️ View Details - Opens detailed user modal
   - ✏️ Edit User - Opens edit modal
   - 🚫 Block/Unblock - Toggles user suspension
   - 🗑️ Delete - Shows confirmation and deletes user

3. **Modals**
   - Customer Detail Modal - Shows comprehensive user info
   - Edit Customer Modal - Form to update user data
   - Delete Confirmation Modal - Prevents accidental deletion

## User Exclusion
The admin user with email `admin@gmail.com` is automatically filtered out from the customer list to prevent accidental modification or deletion of the admin account.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const filteredUsers = response.data.users.filter(user => user.email !== 'admin@gmail.com');
```

## User Model Fields

### Required Fields
- `name` - User's full name
- `email` - Unique email address
- `password` - Hashed password
- `role` - One of: 'customer', 'admin', 'delivery'

### Optional Fields
- `phone` - Contact number
- `profilePicture` - URL to profile image
- `isBlocked` - Boolean (default: false)
- `addresses` - Array of address objects
- `preferences` - Object with user preferences
- `stats` - Object with order statistics

## Database Model Update
Updated the User model to use consistent role values:
- Changed from `'deliveryBoy'` to `'delivery'` for consistency with frontend

## Security Features

1. **Admin-Only Access**
   - All endpoints protected with `protect` and `isAdmin` middleware
   - Regular users cannot access customer management features

2. **Email Validation**
   - Prevents duplicate emails when updating users
   - Validates email format

3. **Password Security**
   - Passwords are never returned in API responses
   - Password hashing handled automatically by User model

4. **Accidental Admin Deletion Prevention**
   - admin@gmail.com is filtered from the list
   - Cannot be edited or deleted through the UI

## How to Access

1. Login as admin (admin@gmail.com)
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
3. Click on "Customer Management" in the sidebar
4. View, search, filter, and manage users

2. Export user data to CSV/Excel
3. Bulk actions (block/delete multiple users)
4. User activity logs
5. Email notifications when users are blocked
6. Role-based permissions management

8. Advanced filtering (date range, location)

## Files Modified

2. `backend/src/models/User.js` - Updated role enum for consistency
3. `backend/src/routes/auth.js` - Already had all necessary endpoints

## Conclusion

The Customer Management feature is fully implemented and ready for use. Administrators can now effectively manage all users in the system with complete control over viewing, editing, suspending, and deleting user accounts, while the system prevents accidental modification of the admin account.
