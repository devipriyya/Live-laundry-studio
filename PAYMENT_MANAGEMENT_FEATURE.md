- Uses the same component for both integrations

## Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```
PaymentManagementPage.jsx (Page wrapper)
└── PaymentManagement.jsx (Main component)
    ├── Payment statistics cards
    ├── Search and filter controls
    ├── Payment table
    └── PaymentDetailModal (Detail view)
```

### Data Flow
1. Static payment data loaded on component mount
2. Client-side filtering and searching
3. Real-time statistics calculation
4. Modal-based detail views

### Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Consistent color scheme with status-based indicators
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Accessible UI components

## Business Logic

### Status Handling
- **Completed**: Successful payments, refundable
- **Pending**: Awaiting confirmation, can be marked as completed
- **Failed**: Unsuccessful payments, can be retried
- **Refunded**: Payments returned to customer, not refundable

### Financial Calculations
- **Total Revenue**: Sum of completed payment amounts
- **Pending Amount**: Sum of pending payment amounts
- **Refunded Amount**: Sum of refunded payment amounts
- **Processing Fees**: Sum of fees for completed payments only

## Future Enhancements

2. Advanced reporting and export options
3. Automated payment reconciliation
4. Multi-currency support
