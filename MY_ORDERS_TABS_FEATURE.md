# My Orders Tabs Feature

## Overview
This feature enhances the "My Orders" page by adding separate tabs for different service types, allowing users to easily filter their orders by service category.

## Service Types
The following service type tabs have been implemented:
1. **All Orders** - Displays all orders regardless of service type
2. **Schedule Wash** - Shows orders related to washing and folding services
3. **Steam Ironing** - Displays orders for steam ironing services
4. **Stain Removal** - Shows orders for stain removal services
5. **Shoe Polish** - Displays orders for shoe cleaning and polishing services
6. **Dry Cleaning** - Shows orders for dry cleaning services

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes
- Modified `frontend/src/pages/MyOrders.jsx` to include tab navigation
- Added state management for active tab (`activeTab`)
- Implemented filtering logic based on service types
- Updated the UI to include a tab navigation bar

### Filtering Logic
The filtering works by examining the `service` property of each item in an order:
- **Schedule Wash**: Matches items with 'wash' or 'fold' in the service name
- **Steam Ironing**: Matches items with 'iron' or 'steam' in the service name
- **Stain Removal**: Matches items with 'stain' in the service name
- **Shoe Polish**: Matches items with 'shoe' or 'polish' in the service name
- **Dry Cleaning**: Matches items with both 'dry' and 'clean' in the service name

### UI Components
- Tab navigation bar with horizontal scrolling for smaller screens
- Visual indication of the active tab with yellow border and text
- Responsive design that works on all device sizes

## Usage
1. Navigate to the "My Orders" page
2. Use the tabs at the top to filter orders by service type
3. The order list will automatically update to show only orders matching the selected service type
4. Use "All Orders" tab to view all orders

## Technical Considerations
- The filtering is case-insensitive
- If an order contains multiple items of different service types, it will appear in any tab that matches at least one of its items
- The existing search and status filter functionality works in conjunction with the service type tabs

## Testing
- Verified that all tabs render correctly
- Confirmed that filtering works as expected
- Tested responsive design on different screen sizes
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Future Improvements
- Add more specific service categories based on business requirements
- Implement server-side filtering for better performance with large datasets
- Add analytics to track which service types are most commonly viewed
