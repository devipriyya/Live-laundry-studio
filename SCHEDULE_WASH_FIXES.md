# Schedule Wash Page Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. **Missing API Import**: The component was not importing the API utility needed to communicate with the backend
2. **Missing createOrderAfterPayment Function**: The component was missing the function to create orders in the backend after successful payment
3. **Missing User Authentication Check**: The handlePayment function was not checking if the user was authenticated
4. **Incomplete Payment Success Handler**: The openRazorpayCheckout function was not creating orders after successful payment

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing API Import
Added the following import to the component:
```javascript
import api from '../../api';
```

### 2. Added Missing createOrderAfterPayment Function
Added the [createOrderAfterPayment](file://c:\Users\User\fabrico\frontend\src\pages\dashboard\DashboardDryCleaning.jsx#L372-L441) function that creates orders in the backend after successful payment:

```javascript
// Create order in backend after successful payment
const createOrderAfterPayment = async (paymentId, amount) => {
  try {
    // Prepare items array for the order
    const items = [];
    Object.entries(selectedItems).forEach(([itemName, quantity]) => {
      Object.values(laundryPricing).forEach(category => {
        const item = category.find(i => i.name === itemName);
        if (item) {
          items.push({
            name: itemName,
            quantity: quantity,
            price: item.price,
            service: 'wash-and-press'
          });
        }
      });
    });

    // Validate that we have items
    if (items.length === 0) {
      throw new Error('No items selected for the order');
    }

    // Prepare order data
    const orderData = {
      items: items,
      pickupDate: pickupDate,
      pickupTime: pickupTime,
      pickupAddress: address,
      contactInfo: contactInfo,
      totalAmount: amount
    };

    console.log('Creating order with data:', orderData);

    // Send order to backend
    const response = await api.post('/orders/dry-cleaning-clothes', orderData);
    
    if (response.data) {
      console.log('Order created successfully:', response.data);
      // Dispatch event to refresh orders in other components
      window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('orderPlaced'));
      // Reset form
      resetForm();
      // Navigate to My Orders page
      alert('Order placed successfully! Redirecting to My Orders page.');
      navigate('/my-orders');
    } else {
      throw new Error('Failed to create order');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating order:', error);
    console.error('Error details:', {
      message: error.message,
      response: error.response?.data,
      status: error.response?.status,
      stack: error.stack
    });
    
    let errorMessage = 'Order was paid but there was an issue saving your order. Please contact support with your payment ID: ' + paymentId;
    
    if (error.response && error.response.data && error.response.data.message) {
      errorMessage = `Order creation failed: ${error.response.data.message}`;
    } else if (error.message) {
      errorMessage = `Order creation failed: ${error.message}`;
    }
    
    alert(errorMessage);
  }
};
```

### 3. Added User Authentication Check
Enhanced the [handlePayment](file://c:\Users\User\fabrico\frontend\src\pages\dashboard\DashboardSchedule.jsx#L276-L304) function to check if the user is authenticated:

```javascript
// Check if user is authenticated
if (!user || !user.email) {
  alert('Please log in to place an order. You will be redirected to the login page.');
  navigate('/login');
  return;
}
```

### 4. Updated Payment Success Handler
Modified the [openRazorpayCheckout](file://c:\Users\User\fabrico\frontend\src\pages\dashboard\DashboardSchedule.jsx#L306-L356) function to call [createOrderAfterPayment](file://c:\Users\User\fabrico\frontend\src\pages\dashboard\DashboardDryCleaning.jsx#L372-L441) after successful payment:

```javascript
handler: function (response) {
  alert(`Payment Successful! Payment ID: ${response.razorpay_payment_id}`);
  console.log('Booking Details:', {
    user: user?.email,
    items: selectedItems,
    pickupDate,
    pickupTime,
    address,
    contact: contactInfo,
    amount,
    paymentId: response.razorpay_payment_id
  });
  
  // Create order in backend after successful payment
  createOrderAfterPayment(response.razorpay_payment_id, amount);
},
```

## Verification
- ✅ Component now imports the required API utility
- ✅ Component has the required [createOrderAfterPayment](file://c:\Users\User\fabrico\frontend\src\pages\dashboard\DashboardDryCleaning.jsx#L372-L441) function
- ✅ Component checks for user authentication before processing payments
- ✅ Component creates orders in the backend after successful payment
- ✅ Component redirects users to "My Orders" page after successful order creation

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5174/dashboard/schedule-wash
2. Select items and fill in the form
3. Proceed to payment and complete the payment process
4. Verify that you see a success message and are redirected to the "My Orders" page
5. Check that the order appears in the "My Orders" page
