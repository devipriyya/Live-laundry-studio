# Customer Management Fix Guide

## Issue
The customer management section in the admin dashboard shows a blank page instead of displaying users with options to suspend/unsuspend, delete, and view.

## Root Cause
The issue is likely due to authentication problems. The customer management functionality requires admin privileges, and if the user is not properly authenticated as an admin, the API calls will fail.

## Solution

### Step 1: Log in as Admin
1. Navigate to `/admin-login-debug`
2. Click on the "Admin" button to log in with admin credentials
3. You will be redirected to the admin dashboard

### Step 2: Access Customer Management
1. In the admin dashboard, click on the "Customer Management" menu item
2. The customer management page should now display all users with the following options:
   - **View**: See detailed customer information
   - **Edit**: Modify customer details
   - **Block/Unblock**: Suspend or unsuspend customer accounts
   - **Delete**: Remove customers from the system

### Step 3: If Still Seeing Blank Page
If you're still seeing a blank page after logging in as admin:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that the backend API is running on `http://localhost:5000`
3. Ensure you're using the correct admin credentials:
   - Email: `admin@gmail.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

### Step 4: API Endpoints Used
The customer management component uses the following API endpoints:
- `GET /api/auth/users` - Fetch all users (admin only)
- `GET /api/auth/users/:id/orders` - Fetch user's order history
- `PUT /api/auth/users/:id` - Update user information
- `DELETE /api/auth/users/:id` - Delete a user
- `PATCH /api/auth/users/:id/block` - Block/unblock a user

### Step 5: Troubleshooting
If the API calls are failing:

1. Make sure you're logged in as an admin
2. Check that the JWT token is being sent in the Authorization header
3. Verify that the backend server is running
4. Check the backend logs for authentication errors

## Features Available
Once properly authenticated, the customer management section provides:

- **User Listing**: Display all customers with filtering and search capabilities
- **User Details**: View comprehensive customer information including:
  - Personal information
  - Order history
  - Account status
  - Preferences
- **User Actions**:
  - Block/unblock accounts
  - Edit user information
  - Delete users
  - Export customer data
- **Statistics**: Overview of user metrics including total users, blocked users, etc.

## Sample Data Mode
If the API is not accessible, the component will display sample data to demonstrate the functionality.
