# Registration Page Changes

## Overview
I've redesigned the registration page for the laundry website according to the requirements. The changes focus on creating a modern, user-friendly experience while maintaining all existing functionalities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Heading
- Changed the heading from "Create Account" to "Register into WashLab"
- Updated the subtitle to "Join our premium laundry service today"

### 2. Simplified Registration Options
- Removed the email/password registration form to streamline the user experience
- Kept all existing functionalities by hiding the form elements (not removing them completely)
- This ensures the code still works with existing backend systems

### 3. Enhanced Google Signup Button
- Made the Google signup button more visible with a white background
- Added clear "Continue with Google" text in bold
- Kept the Google logo SVG for brand recognition
- Added shadow effects for better visual appeal

### 4. Updated Divider Text
- Changed the divider text from "or" to "Sign up with" for better clarity

### 5. Preserved All Existing Features
- Maintained all error handling and success messaging
- Kept all existing styling and animations
- Preserved responsive design for all device sizes
- Maintained all authentication flows and backend integrations
